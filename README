Jukebox
========

Jukebox is designed to rate RFID data via a serial device (but can be easily adapted to any serial device).
Using this code it checks a database to find what command to run. So you may tag a CD case and have
jukebox load the album playlist.

##Warning
If used as is this code may be unsafe! Since most people will run jukebox as root to access /dev/tty* devices 
yet anyone can alter the database. solution? add a rule to let your regular user access the device.(recommended)
make the db, jukebox and addtags root writeable only.(bad choice)

##TODO
# Make a nice gui
# Make code safe
# Add command types
